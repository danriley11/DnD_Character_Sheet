# DnD_Character_Sheet
A passion project of mine to help learn and consolidate new skills and development strategies.

My goal is to recreate an older website of mine (which you can find here: https://gentle-ridge-88658.herokuapp.com/) using React.JS with complete functionality.

My commits and merges will have special characters to help identify new, removed or coming-soon features.
Legend:
"+" : A new or updated aspect
"-" : A removed aspect
"~" : What's to be done next in the next commit
